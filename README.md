BigQuery is a fully managed, serverless data warehouse solution provided by Google Cloud Platform (GCP). It allows users to analyze massive datasets using SQL queries quickly and efficiently, without the need for managing infrastructure or provisioning resources. It also extends support to Machine Learning, Data Analysis and Buisness Intelligence.
